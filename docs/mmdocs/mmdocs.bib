abstract={A theoretical parametric study is given of a TE$_{11}$-to-HE$_{11}$ mode converter consisting of a
          section of cylindrical corrugated waveguide with varying slot depth. The analysis makes use of
          modal field-matching techniques to determine the scatter matrix of the mode converter from which
          we deduce its propagation properties. It is shown that a mode converter consisting of only five
          slots achieves a return loss better than 30~dB over the band $2.7<ka<3.8$ (where $a$ is the internal
          radius of the waveguide) with the HE$_{11}$ mode in the balanced conditions at $ka=2.9$.
          The predicted results are in very good agreement with experimental data.},
